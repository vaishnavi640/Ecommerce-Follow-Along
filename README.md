# Project Overview: E-Commerce Application (MERN Stack )

This project will guide you through building  full-stack E-commerce website  using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It allows users to browse products, add them to the cart, and proceed to checkout. Admin users can manage products, view orders, and update inventory.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js, Redux, React Router
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens), bcryptjs
- **Payment Gateway:** Stripe
- **State Management:** Redux for managing app state
- **Deployment:** Heroku (or any cloud provider like AWS)

## Key Features

- **User Authentication:** 
  - Register, login, and logout functionality with secure password storage using bcryptjs.
  - JWT-based authentication to manage sessions.
  
- **Product Management:**
  - Display products with sorting and filtering options based on categories, price, ratings, etc.
  - Admin panel to add, update, or delete products.

- **Shopping Cart:**

  - Users can review their order and proceed with payment.

- **Order Management:**
  - Users can view their order history and track current orders.
  - Admin can update order status (Pending, Shipped, Delivered).

- **Responsive Design:**
  - Fully responsive UI to support different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile).

- **Search and Filter:**
  - Search products by name and filter by categories, price range, and ratings.

- **Security Features:**
  - Input validation and data sanitization.
  - HTTPS support for secure data transmission.



# Milestone 1: 

In a MERN stack application, login and sign-up (authentication) typically involve a process where users can register (sign-up) with their credentials, and later log in using those credentials. The login and sign-up process can be divided into several steps, with separate client-side (React) and server-side (Node.js/Express) handling.

# Milestone 2:

# Login Page - README

## Overview

This is a simple **Login Page** built using **React** and **Tailwind CSS**. The page includes a form where users can enter their **email** and **password**, along with a **"Remember me"** checkbox and a **"Forgot Password?"** link. It uses **React's `useState` hook** to manage the form's state (email and password).

## Key Features

- **Email & Password Fields**: Users can enter their credentials for login.
- **Remember Me Checkbox**: Allows users to stay logged in on future visits.
- **Forgot Password Link**: A link for users who have forgotten their password.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a good user experience on both mobile and desktop.
- **React State Management**: Utilizes `useState` to handle form values for email and password.
